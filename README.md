# Can you really go out?

### I have started to use neovim. (Yes, I use neovim btw) and I wanted to learn building CLIs using go and I decided to build this weather app as a small side-project

## What does it do?
### This app basically brings in the weather information on the TERMINAL for a location by default. I've set the app to my location.

## Command Line Flags
` -l : To set a location for it to display the weather for.`
` -d : To look forward into the Future! Yeah you can time travel. All jokes aside, use values 1 and 2 to see the weather for the tomorrow or the day after tomorrow`

### If only I could look forward into the future. :p


## Thanks for reading my little side-project!

## Also I'm open to feedbacks from any of you CRITICS out there. :)
